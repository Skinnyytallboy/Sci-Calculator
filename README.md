# Scientific Calculator
Hey everyone, i created the scientific calculator using C# and Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 community edition and here is the complete project with all the necessary file. I uploaded all the files which might be helpful. Also i uploaded a Video/mkv so you can veiw what this calculator is capable of.
This calculator can perform basic and some most frequently used advanced mathematics calculations as well as number conversion problems.
All the files are in the Folder and you can reach out to me incase of any question. 
Hopefully you like it... Thanks :)
